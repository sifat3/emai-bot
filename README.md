# emai-bot
This is an email bot, by this you don't have to type anything to send an email (by gmail). Just update the e-mail dictionary an run.
Use your email address and password in 'your email' and 'your password'
Update the email dictionary as key value pairs,inside the demo key use a name and in demo value use the receivers' email address.

NOTE:you have to install speech_recognition and Pyaudio and pyttsx3 by using pip.
  for speech_recognition - 'pip install SpeechRecognition'
  for Pyaudio - 'pip install PyAudio'
  for pyttsx3 - 'pip install pyttsx3'
  
  some of you will face problem installing Pyaudio.You can download pyaudio.whl file unofficially and     install by using 'pip install filename'

There is another problem you'll face that google doesn't support any third party to send your email.So to enable third party use,you have to go to your manage account in your google account and go to security and turn the less secure app access on.

You're ready to go!

Run it!

It will ask to whom you want to send email?
-use the key you used in the dictionary,it will fetch the email address from there.
And also do the other things on it's own.
